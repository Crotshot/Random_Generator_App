# Random_Generator_App
A console application developed for mobile app development 1, made in with intellij using kotlin


Users create "Items" which are object that have a name and a weight
Items are then added to "Item Lists" for random selection


##Example 1

A user adds an Item called "Heads" with a weight of 10, the user then adds another item called "Tails" with the same weight
When both items are added to a list  a user can then use the random selection functionality to generate a virtual coin flip between to two items

##Example 2

Similarly again a user adds more items, this time adding items called "One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five" and "Six" with equal weights of 2.
When added to a list together the user can effectively reproduce a die roll.

For instance lets say item "Four" has a wight of 10 which is 5 times higher than all other items, this effectively creates a heavily loaded die
